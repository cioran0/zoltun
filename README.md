Some things in source that can be compiled not yet in build - 
* currently only supports zai api, but any can be added in the relevant section. Should be coming to source and prob next build soon. OR will likely be first.
* need to manually install/move theme directory from temp because pyinstaller build creates temp not replicated structure until I figure workaround
