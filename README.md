Some things in source that can be compiled not yet in build - 
* exception thrown if you don't enter the api key after 4 times and exit
* theme can be selected using inputTheme (must be selected in both .py files)
* dropdown exists but is non-operable and needs theming finished, comment it out
* currently only supports zai api, but any can be added in the relevant section. Should be coming to source and prob next build soon. OR will likely be first.
